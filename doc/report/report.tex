  \section{Introduction}
  Starting our research, there were a plethora of information on the various
  methods to obtain or at least approximate an optimal traveling salesman tour.
  We found a variety of algorithms and heuristic approaches. Some were
  straightforward such the nearest neighbor heuristic, while others had a more
  methodical approach to approximating an optimal tour. After some deliberation
  we decided upon the Christofides approximation algorithm as there seemed to be
  ample documentation regarding the algorithm as well a quality that would
  satisfy the required bounds.
